# React Plotly

## Build
1) Download the github repository  
2) Run npm install  
3) Run gulp  

## How-To
Each component implements a corresponding plotly chart. As props they require containerId, data, and layout. ContainerId simply becomes the id of the div containing the chart (must be unique?). For documentation on what goes into data and layout, see the [plotly documentation](https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/).
